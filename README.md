# OpenSHAPA Plugin Development

This guide is intended to be an in-depth walkthrough towards creating
an OpenSHAPA plugin. I will assume that the reader has a working 
knowledge of Java and Swing development.

The guide itself is available from the [Wiki page](https://github.com/dteoh/openshapa-plugin-dev-guide/wiki).
